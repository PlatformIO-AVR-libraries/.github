## Hello everyone!


This organisation is intended for all libraries that are meant to be used with Microchip AVR 8-bit devices.
All libraries are written in PlatformIO, using c++. Libraries are compatible with arduino framework,
but compatibility with specific boards and devices should be checked for each library.

👩‍💻 Useful resources:
- all Microchip AVR datasheets can be found on this site: https://www.microchip.com
- AVR libC site: https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/
